=============================================

solve_maze.rb is a program that solves mazes.
To run it, run

  ./solve_maze.rb <file_name>

where <file_name> is the name of the text file that contains a maze.
Several sample mazes are included in the mazes folder.
When run as above, solve_mazes will simply print out the solution.
To watch the maze being solved, you can use the -t tag, which takes a numerical argument.
The argument represents the number of seconds to pause between each step of maze solving.
To watch the App Academy provided example, run

  ./solve_maze.rb mazes/aA_maze.txt -t 0.5

You can also use the -h flag for command line help.

The solver is fairly robust.
It can detect improperly formatted maze files, and it can tell if a maze is impossible to solve.
As an example, maze4.txt is unsolvable.

The solver is only very slightly optimized.
It will never walk over the same square twice, but otherwise the solution path it finds can be quite inefficient.

I have also included a suite of rspec tests in the spec folder.
They should test all the public methods of the classes used by solve_maze.
